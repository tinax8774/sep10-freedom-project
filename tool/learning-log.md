### 3/7/2025:
* Watched half of [Animate.CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA&t=145s) video
    * Helped me understand how to make the animation work
    * Helped me understand the code that was being shown on the website
* After watching the video I changed the animation that was used and the time of delay.
    * `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__flash animate__delay-1s">Hello</h1>` used to make a animation of flash and delay it by 1 second when first entered into the website.
    * Could add more than one animation just need to add another line of code for it.
* Some challenges were typing the code correctly
    * When writing the class there was always a double _ and I kept forgetting it.
    * Remembering that the delay goes along with the animation in the same line of code.
* Next Step:
    * Continuing to figure out what the other code do on the website.
    * Find a way to use it on my freedom project.
