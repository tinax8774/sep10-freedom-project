# Choosing a topic
The topic I chose for this project is environment because I was always interested in how the environment has been affected by global warming and hoped to learn more by doing this year long research project on it. I seen all over the news about global warming on the Earth but have never really focused on doing research about it so I'm excited to it for this project. Two of my backup choices are chemistry because I enjjoy science and graphic design because it sounds really intersting. I have not fully done my research but some sources I have found for my topic are [What are environmental issues] (https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-issues)
