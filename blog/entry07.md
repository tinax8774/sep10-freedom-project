# Entry 7
##### 6/3/2025


### Content
Since the last blog entry we have done beyond MVP, in-class presentation and elevator pitch along with the expo. In this final blog entry below will be some of the takeaways that I have from the in-class presentations and elevator pitch.


### Takeaways from in-class presentation
* I would definitely try and look at the audience more as I did look at people but not a lot.
* Making my takeaways more about my personal situation when doing the freedom project.
* Try to explain a bit more of my project as it was quite brief.


### Takeaways from Expo elevator pitch
* Remembering to give the hook as I kind of forgot about it
* Getting ready for any questions that is asked
* Explaining a bit more of my part B ideas

Also [my in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-YT419ezOEkzjZ5IXaKf8Eo9za56W6TnmapehzMP36Q/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)


### EDP(Engineering design process)
There isn't really a EDP anymore as we are now done with the project but it would be finishing the final step which is to communicate the result as we did during the expo last week and in the showcase later this week.


### Takeaways
Most of my takeaways were said previously and those will be the things I will improve on as I enter my junior year and my next freedom project. This year was fun and making this project but also difficult with the challenges along the way. This is the final blog entry and I will take everything I learned this year and make my project next year better than my current one.
