# Entry 2: Researching Software and Hardware
##### 11/04/2024

## Context
It's been a while since entry 1 and lately we have started researching recent technology on our topic. Over the past couple of weeks we had started doing research on our topics and lately it has been on hardware and software. As my topic for my freedom project is on environment there are many components to the topic so I had to find mostly reliable sources as there are many ideas on the topic. Most of my sofware websites mostly have to do with monitoring the forest and tracking deforestation over the past few years in our world. Hardware had mostly included things that are beneficial for the environment and prevent things including global warming, deforestation and many other ways you could help improve the world that you are living in today. 

### Software
Some of the software websites I have found are [Forest Monitoring Designed for Action](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/), [Forestry app 101:Creating a Forest monitoring app](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests), [Decarbonization requires comprehensive electricity and certificate management](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests), [Adaptation Components of NDCs: A Global Perspective for Countries](https://www.wri.org/events/2022/8/adaptation-components-ndcs-global-perspective-countries), [What are environmental issues?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-issues). Most of these links include the diffferent apps that can measure mostly the trees in the forest as deforestation is a huge problem especiallly since people cut down trees to get more space in order to create more space for living. With these tracking items it can track trees in order ot be able to prevent the world from e
