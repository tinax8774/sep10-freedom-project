# Entry 2: Researching Software and Hardware
##### 11/04/2024

## Context
Over the past couple of weeks we had started doing research on our topics and lately it has been on hardware and software. As my topic for my freedom project is on environment there are many components to the topic so I had to find mostly reliable sources as there are many ideas on the topic. 
### Software
Some of the software websites I have found are [Forest Monitoring Designed for Action](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/), [Forestry app 101:Creating a Forest monitoring app](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests), [Decarbonization requires comprehensive electricity and certificate management](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests), [Adaptation Components of NDCs: A Global Perspective for Countries](https://www.wri.org/events/2022/8/adaptation-components-ndcs-global-perspective-countries), [What are environmental issues?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-issues)
