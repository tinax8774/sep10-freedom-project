# Entry 2: Researching Software and Hardware
##### 11/04/2024

## Context
It's been a while since entry 1 and lately we have started researching recent technology on our topic. Over the past couple of weeks we had started doing research on our topics and lately it has been on hardware and software. As my topic for my freedom project is on environment there are many components to the topic so I had to find mostly reliable sources as there are many ideas on the topic. Most of my sofware websites mostly have to do with monitoring the forest and tracking deforestation over the past few years in our world. Hardware had mostly included things that are beneficial for the environment and prevent things including global warming, deforestation and many other ways you could help improve the world that you are living in today. 

### Software
Some of the software websites I have found are:

[Forest Monitoring Designed for Action](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) 

1. This app shows the amount of trees being cut down over time. 
2. They have monitored over 840 million hectares of forest.

[Forestry app 101:Creating a Forest monitoring app](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests)

1. It talks about foreset monitoring and and works with global forest watch
2. Also tracks the amount of trees left in the forest.
3. Easy to use

[Decarbonization requires comprehensive electricity and certificate management](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests)

1.It tracks the amount of energy being used
2.Results can come 24/7
3. Demonstate the impact people have on the environment.

[Adaptation Components of NDCs: A Global Perspective for Countries](https://www.wri.org/events/2022/8/adaptation-components-ndcs-global-perspective-countries)

*Gives informatioin about the environmental issues inn the world
*Gives info of how to adopt to the changing environmennt on the world

[What are environmental issues?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-issues).

*It talks about the issue in society today
*Shows increase in greenhouse gases. 

Most of these links include the diffferent apps that can measure mostly the trees in the forest as deforestation is a huge problem especiallly since people cut down trees to get more space in order to create more space for living. With these tracking items it can track trees in order ot be able to prevent the world from e

### Hardware

[How to make a DIY solar oven](https://www.homesciencetools.com/article/how-to-build-a-solar-oven-project/?srsltid=AfmBOooKn_ikQrPyia57a269EgVP5m6uj0HrLuN2CDrjfqIURFYTpyZh)

* It talks about how you could make s solar oven to reduce the carbon dioxide that that you release when you cook things on the stove
* It has a better impact on the environment

[EDYN garden sensor](https://www.wevolver.com/specs/edyn.garden.sensor)

*Shows the moisture of the soil
*Help improve plant health if needed
*Helps tell if soil is too dry or too moist

[Top 20 Zero Waste Products for Home](https://www.loopify.world/blog/post/zero-waste-products)

*Shows items that are good for the environment
*It includes things taht doesn''t involve plastic which affecs the animals in the world. 

[The Impact of Smart Recycling: How Technology is Revolutionizing Waste Management](https://www.smartsortai.com/the-impact-of-smart-recycling-how-technology-is-revolutionizing-waste-management/#:~:text=By%20efficiently%20sorting%20and%20separating,associated%20with%20extraction%20and%20production.)

*Helps make our world a cleaner place
*Reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses.
