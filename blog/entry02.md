# Entry 2: Researching Software and Hardware
##### 11/04/2024

## Context
It's been a while since entry 1 and lately we have started researching recent technology on our topic. Over the past couple of weeks we had started doing research on our topics and lately it has been on hardware and software. As my topic for my freedom project is on environment there are many components to the topic so I had to find mostly reliable sources as there are many ideas on the topic. Most of my sofware websites mostly have to do with monitoring the forest and tracking deforestation over the past few years in our world. Hardware had mostly included things that are beneficial for the environment and prevent things including global warming, deforestation and many other ways you could help improve the world that you are living in today. In this blog I will talk about some of the websites that I have found about the topic of environetn. 

### Software
Some of the software websites I have found are:

[Forest Monitoring Designed for Action](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) 

1. This app shows the amount of trees being cut down over time. 
2. They have monitored over 840 million hectares of forest.

[Forestry app 101:Creating a Forest monitoring app](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests)

1. It talks about foreset monitoring and and works with global forest watch
2. Also tracks the amount of trees left in the forest.
3. Easy to use

[Decarbonization requires comprehensive electricity and certificate management](https://3sidedcube.com/projects/a-conservation-app-to-save-our-forests)
1. It talks about forest monitoring and works with global forest watch
2. Also tracks the amount of trees are left in forests
3. Easy to use

[Adaptation Components of NDCs: A Global Perspective for Countries](https://www.wri.org/events/2022/8/adaptation-components-ndcs-global-perspective-countries)

1. Gives information abou tht enevironmnetnal issues in the world
2. Gives info of how to adapt to the changing environment on the world

[What are environmental issues?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-issues).

1. It talks about the issues in society today
2. Shows increase in greenhouse gasses

Most of these links include the diffferent apps that can measure mostly the trees in the forest as deforestation is a huge problem especiallly since people cut down trees to get more space in order to create more space for living. With these tracking items it can track trees in order ot be able to prevent the world from e

### Hardware

[How to make a DIY solar oven](https://www.homesciencetools.com/article/how-to-build-a-solar-oven-project/?srsltid=AfmBOooKn_ikQrPyia57a269EgVP5m6uj0HrLuN2CDrjfqIURFYTpyZh)

1. It talks about how you could make a solar oven to reduce the carbon dioxide that you relesease when you cook things on the stove
2. It has a better impact on the environment

[EDYN garden sensor](https://www.wevolver.com/specs/edyn.garden.sensor)

1. Shows the moisture of the soil
2. Help improve plant health if needed
3. Helps tell if soil is too dry or too moist

[Top 20 Zero Waste Products for Home](https://www.loopify.world/blog/post/zero-waste-products)

1. Shows items that are good for the environment
2. It includes thingst hat doesn't involve plastic which affects the animal in the world.

[List of ENERGY STAR Energy Efficient Products](https://www.energystar.gov/products/products-list)

1. Shows things that consume less energy than others
2. Most of these items are located in a normal household.
   
[The Impact of Smart Recycling: How Technology is Revolutionizing Waste Management](https://www.smartsortai.com/the-impact-of-smart-recycling-how-technology-is-revolutionizing-waste-management/#:~:text=By%20efficiently%20sorting%20and%20separating,associated%20with%20extraction%20and%20production.)

1. Helps make our world a cleaner place
2. Reduces the amount of greenhouse gases
Most of these websites shows the things that can be used in daily life that doesn't have a huge impact on the environment and most of the items on the lists are beneficial in a way. Using some of these items can help make our planet a better place and a safer environment.

### Engineering Design Process
The current step I am on is planning because currently we are gathering information on our topic and preparing for when we actually start writing the codes for the webiste. The other step we are also on is researching as we are trying to find some info we can include when making the website fo rhte project. 

### Skills
I have learned how to find credible sources as in the past I don't pay much attention to the sources that I am finding but with this project I have found that some sources are more credible than others. Certain websites doesn't give details that can benefit research in any way. 

Another skill I have is time management because I have planned out everything I have to do and try to make time in my day to finish writing these blogs and balance all my other classes. Time had always been a issue while trying to complete all my work but knowing that these assignments are beneficial so it makes me realize that I have to finish these on time which gives me time to do other stuff after finishing writing all my homework.
