Since the previous blog entry we have been learning our tool on our own and mine is AnimateCSS. Somethings that I have learned from my tool is how to make an element have animation. From unit 1 when we did normal webdesign I did animation but at that time I did not know how to control the animation. With the AnimateCSS website I learned how to control the animation such as duration, repeat and changing the animation.
