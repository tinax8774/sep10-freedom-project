Since the previous blog entry we have been learning our tool on our own and mine is AnimateCSS. Something that I have learned from my tool is how to make an element have animation. From unit 1 when we did normal web design I did animation but at that time I did not know how to control the animation. With the AnimateCSS website I learned how to control the animation such as duration, repeat and changing the animation. Below is some code I wrote and what they do.


* `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>` is used to set a certain element to have the animation of bounce and in this case the element is a  `h1` that says An animated element. For this specific one the only thing that is happening here is putting an animation for the class.
* `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-2s">An animated element</h1>` is similar to the previous code but with the `animate__delay` element it causes a delay when you load the page. With this it has both an animation and a delay to it.
* `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-2s animate__faster">An animated element</h1>` is used to make the animation faster than it normally is but still maintaining the delay in the animation. It includes both a delay but it also makes the animation go faster.
* `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-2s animate__repeat-2">An animated element</h1>` is used to make the animation repeat twice, delay for 2 seconds and the animation is still bounce.


The changes that I made was the time of the animation and basically trying out the different types of animation that is on the website.


### Sources
For this past month there weren't really many sources used except for this [Animate.CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA&t=145s) and then the actual website for AnimateCSS.


### EDP (Engineering design process)
The current step we are on is planning most likely as we are just finished learning our tool which is kind of like the plan before we make the actual project itself. Our next step is planning out the project and actually coding it.


### Skills
One skill I had was time management. With a quite stressful past month I made time to actually learn my tool and not do everything last minute. Another skill is learning on my own as this is one of the first times we had to learn a tool on our own so that was definitely new. With not much prior knowledge this was something that was definitely a new skill and applying LOYO (learn on your own) this was a new skill that I had developed. 


### Next Steps
Next would be prepping for coding and I will need to find a good animation and timing which I am still in the process of doing but we are definitely near the stage of actually writing code for the freedom project.
