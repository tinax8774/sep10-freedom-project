### Context
In the past month we have been coding our project by starting out with our MVP. We been basically writing out our website and designing it along with doing our plan and our wireframes. Some of the main challenges that I had faced while doing this website was time and the code not working. As there was a trip I did have to rush the last part of it in order to finish it. When writing my part A which is existing technology there were some problems that came up when writing the code for the carousel as sometimes it was just not working properly. Below is one piece of my project.
