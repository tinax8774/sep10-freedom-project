# Entry 6
##### 5/6/2025

### Context
In the past month we have been coding our project by starting out with our MVP. We been basically writing out our website and designing it along with doing our plan and our wireframes. Some of the main challenges that I had faced while doing this website was time and the code not working. As there was a trip I did have to rush the last part of it in order to finish it. When writing my part A which is existing technology there were some problems that came up when writing the code for the carousel as sometimes it was just not working properly. When making my MVP I used a lot of HTML and some bootstrap components that included navbar, accordion, collapse, carousel and cards. Below is one piece of my project.

For now this is done until we start beyond MVP.

### Sources
There were not that many sources that was used but I did use [bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/collapse/) and I used my [tool](https://animate.style/#best-practices) which is basically all of the sources that I used for this website.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
We were just in step 5 as we made a prototype and the next one is 7 which is to improve it which is beyond MVP

### Skills
Two skills I developed is time management and organizaiton. Time management came from making sure that I finish the MVP on time and doing this blog entry early. Organization is keeping track of what I need to do in order to turn in all my assignmnets on time.

### Next Steps
In the following weeks I will be focusing on adding some colors and change some things around as now all the information is done.
