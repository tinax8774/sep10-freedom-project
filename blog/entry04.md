# Entry 4: Choosing a tool
##### 02/24/25

### Content
In the last month we have been choosing a tool to use for our freedom project. At first my first choice was to use a-fram but after tinkering with it my final choice will be animateCSS. I tinkered with it by using the code that was already provided and changed somethings that would change the animation of the object. I changed things such as duration, delay time and the display of the object you are animating.
