# Entry 4: Choosing a tool
##### 02/24/25


### Context
In the last month we have been choosing a tool to use for our freedom project. At first my first choice was to use a-frame but after tinkering with it my final choice will be animateCSS. I tinkered with it by using the code that was already provided and changed some things that would change the animation of the object. I changed things such as duration, delay time and the display of the object you are animating. I have not fully figured out how to use it but I have an idea of what is gonna happen with it. Below is some of the tinkering I was doing.


``` CSS
.animate__animated animate__bounce animate__repeat-2 {
               display: inline-block;
               margin: 0,0.5rem;


               animation: bounce;
               animation-duration: 2s;
               animate-delay: 0.9s;
           }
           .animate__animated animate__bounce animate__repeat-2 {
               --animation-duration: 3s;


           }
           :root {
               --animation-duration: 700ms;
               --animate-delay: 0.8s;
           }
```
Some things that are different from the things that were on the website is the amount of time for `animation-duration`, `animation-delay`. With those changes it can change the way the animation moves which in this case is a set of words. The code above isn't complete so it will not work just yet.


### Sources
There were not really any websites that were used except for the website for the tool. The website that I used was [animate.css](https://animate.style/#best-practices) which is where I got my code from. I also used a youtube video to try and understand the website. The link for the video is [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA).


### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
From what it looks like the process we are currently on is a plan or research as we are using research to figure out how to use our tool. It shows plans as we are learning this tool in order to prepare for when we actually start to code our freedom project.


### Skill
A skill I developed was patience as I usually don't just sit here trying to learn something new so this was definitely something different. Another skill was time management because I took my free time (which was not a lot) to patiently tinker with this tool and try to learn it. I had a lot of work this past month but still tried to learn it.


### Next Steps
In the upcoming week I will be fully trying to learn this tool and use it on the actual freedom project. Although this past month has not been easy I know it will just get better so I'm excited to continue this.
