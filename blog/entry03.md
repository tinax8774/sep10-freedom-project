### Brainstorming new technology for my topic
In the last week we have been brainstorming some potential inventions that can be done about our topic. I been trying to think of something that would be beneficial for our environment but at the same time I was trying to find some things that can mesasure things in our world. two of my potential ideas that I have for future inventions was like devices that can measure like the climate in our world but without scientist having to check it every once in a while. I got this idea when researching as I was trying to find some things I can possibly make differently and hasn't already existed which was harder than part A as we could just get the information off google. So something that I realized was that obviously there is the drone that is flying around right now so what about a drone that could possibly do the same thing that could be used for plastics.

My ideas:
* First Idea: A device that can measure the change in our environment
   * What if there was a single device that can measure every change there is in the environment without having scientists measuring them
   * It could have multiple button and each one of them can tell someone something different about something in our environment
* Second Idea: A device that measures the carbon dioxide level
   * This device can be found like all across the country so you see the level anywhere
   * The amount of carbon dioxide will be updated everyday so it will be accurate
* Third Idea: 4D printing
   * Obviously 3D printing was a thing so what about a 4D printing
   * It could be used to print building blocks that can form a building without making it over complicated
   * It can also build robots that can adapt to any environment which can also help with the exploration of planets right now
* Fourth idea: Solar powered water purifier
   * What if there is a device that can possibly save electricity but also give a person clean water
   * Instead of using a normal water purifier that needs electricity to work it can just work off solar power
* Fifth Idea: A drone that can cleanup plastic in the ocean
   * As currently there are plastic in the ocean which is causing problems for animals so if the drone can pick up the plastic so people donâ€™t have to worry about it
   * When they see a piece of plastic a person can control the drone and have it pick it up and get rid of it.

  For my first idea one of the things that made me interested in that potential device is from this image:
  

### Engineerying Design process
Currently we are on the third step which is brainstorming ideas as seen with the title of this blog of brainstorming new topics. Although this has been the most fun part it was hard to come up with ideas. The next steps will probably be to continue doing our research for our project and prepping to code when we get to that point in the project. 
### Skills
One of the skills I have developed with this project is time management because I am so used to doing all of my work last minute but still sometimes I still do that but not as much as the past. Both this class and the project has made me realize that I need to make more time to do all of my work before anything else and to finish everything on time. 

Another skill is creativity becacuse something I have really not thought of is potential future inventions and it was fun to come up with some ideas that have never existed. I was never someone who had interested in making something creative but this project definitely has changed my perspective. 
### Next Steps
The next steps would be to finish our Part B research and prepping ofr the actual code writing of the main projects in the upcoming semester. Although there is still so much to do in six months but it will be fun and productive time and this will definitelly be intersting.
