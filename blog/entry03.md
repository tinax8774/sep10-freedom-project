### Brainstorming new technology for my topic
In the last week we have been brainstorming some potential inventions that can be done about our topic. I been trying to think of something that would be beneficial for our environment but at the same time I was trying to find some things that can mesasure things in our world. two of my potential ideas that I have for future inventions was like devices that can measure like the climate in our world but without scientist having to check it every once in a while. I got this idea when researching as I was trying to find some things I can possibly make differently and hasn't already existed which was harder than part A as we could just get the information off google. So something that I realized was that obviously there is the drone that is flying around right now so what about a drone that could possibly do the same thing that could be used for plastics.

My ideas:
* First Idea: A device that can measure the change in our environment
   * What if there was a single device that can measure every change there is in the environment without having scientists measuring them
   * It could have multiple button and each one of them can tell someone something different about something in our environment
* Second Idea: A device that measures the carbon dioxide level
   * This device can be found like all across the country so you see the level anywhere
   * The amount of carbon dioxide will be updated everyday so it will be accurate
* Third Idea: 4D printing
   * Obviously 3D printing was a thing so what about a 4D printing
   * It could be used to print building blocks that can form a building without making it over complicated
   * It can also build robots that can adapt to any environment which can also help with the exploration of planets right now
* Fourth idea: Solar powered water purifier
   * What if there is a device that can possibly save electricity but also give a person clean water
   * Instead of using a normal water purifier that needs electricity to work it can just work off solar power
* Fifth Idea: A drone that can cleanup plastic in the ocean
   * As currently there are plastic in the ocean which is causing problems for animals so if the drone can pick up the plastic so people donâ€™t have to worry about it
   * When they see a piece of plastic a person can control the drone and have it pick it up and get rid of it.
