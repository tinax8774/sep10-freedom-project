| Farzona  |I really liked how u included images of the environment becasue not everyone would be able to know what parts of the environmonet you could be talking about, but the images made it clear on what you're talking about.   | I think you should consider spacing out the context part so that it looks better on a desktop because you can't really see all the text on a desktop version.
|Winnie  |I like the images you put and also these button that yout put. Its really cool how when u click on the button these info cards pop out.   |Some things you can consider is making the cards alittle more spaced out.
| Rain Song  | I like how you have everything set up and your content seems to be organized | Consider making your website more responsive to breakpoints via the grid system and maybe @media.
| Alberto | I like that you have a bootstrap navbar so that people won't be confused with the amount of information on one line.  | Try and add spacing to your content so it does not look like it is cramped(Sorry idk if I spelled that right) together.
